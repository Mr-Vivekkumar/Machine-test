# Benefits Selection Project

## Project Overview
This project is a flexible benefits solution that allows users to select benefits from three different plans: Health, Life, and Accident. Each benefit has associated points and a multiplier to calculate the price. Users have a wallet amount of 1400, and the application dynamically updates the available amount or the amount the user needs to pay based on their selections.

## Features
1. **Benefit Selection**: Users can select one benefit from each plan.
2. **Benefit Calculation**: Calculates the price based on points and multipliers.
3. **Wallet Management**: Updates the available or payable amount based on the selected benefits.
4. **Summary Update**: Refreshes the summary section with each selection.
5. **Final Summary**: Prepares a final summary on checkout.
